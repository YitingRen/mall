Java Web developer

Use Maven to create web project. I use MyBatis, SpringMVC to set up the project. Use mysql to
create databases, we will have eight tables for different modules.
For the user system module, I store some properties for user by using mysql , also we use ses-
sion to store information of specific users. The system has category-management module. Admin can add, delete, update categories. And I am working on the product module. It is quite complicated. For the front end, it can show details, lists of products, and it also has search bar. For the back end, admin can update products, including upload images, delete and add items. I complete it by using technolo- gies, like ftp, SpringMVC, MyBatis and so on.
Something to do: User can add products to their shopping cart, and pay for it. Admin can read the order lists to get the order details.
